In NLP, the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) and SuperGLUE benchmarks are used to evaluate language models' performance on tasks such as sentiment analysis, textual entailment, and semantic similarity. These benchmarks assess models' adaptability to unseen data and provide a comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities. In Time Series Analysis, datasets such as M3 and M4 are used to evaluate prediction models, while datasets like ETTm2 and ECL cover various domains. Multi-task learning is a technique that trains a model on multiple related tasks to improve performance and generalization. It is used in NLP to leverage shared knowledge across tasks and in Time Series Analysis to handle missing values, anomalies, and noise. Researchers use multi-task learning to improve time series forecasting and handle complex data.

      "Mathematical reasoning is a challenging task for Large Language Models (LLMs) that requires understanding mathematical concepts, computation, and multi-round reasoning. Existing methods can be categorized into three types: prompting, pretraining, and finetuning. Prompting methods utilize well-crafted prompts to extract LLMs' inherent mathematical reasoning skills without parameter updates. Pretraining methods pre-train LLMs on large-scale corpora containing mathematical problems. Finetuning methods refine LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities through targeted training. Recent studies have attempted to enable LLMs to perform self-correction by either prompting or fine-tuning methods. However, existing self-correction research can be broadly classified into two categories: prompt-based methods and SFT-based methods. Our proposed Chain of Self-Correction (CoSC) method embeds a chain of self-correction as an inherent capability in LLMs through parameter fine-tuning, modeling mathematical reasoning as a multi-round procedure during the training stage. Our method conducts verification in a step-by-step manner, significantly improving the verification process in self-correction.\n",
