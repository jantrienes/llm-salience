They are important when you are looking more at the details of the trial in terms of generalizability and applicability for patients that you see in clinic. However, if I am writing a stand-alone report, this could be one thing that would take potentially a secondary seat compared to the other factors."

Usually, these are things that the authors think are potential next steps. While they are definitely helpful, they are not necessarily always based on the opinion of the authors themselves. So I would potentially leave it out and have the reader get to that conclusion themselves."
