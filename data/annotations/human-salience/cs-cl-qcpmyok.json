Just listing related work without explaining the connection might be informative, but it doesn\u2019t really add much value. To make the summary standalone, it\u2019s important to address the main topic clearly. Since we\u2019re just focusing on the related work section, not the whole paper, questions about methods or future directions aren\u2019t as relevant here.",
