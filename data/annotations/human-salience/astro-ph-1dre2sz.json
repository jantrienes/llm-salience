    "comments": "I think it would be useful to classify paper into theory, method, and d observation (empirical). A theory paper might not have any data evidence in it, or a method paper can propose a computational method with no specific scientific finding (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00908). I want to think about the summary for a science paper like an information funnel. You start with large picture (context), then you provide a more detailed picture (a hypothesis, theory, etc), then you describe how this is tested (methods, techniques, data), and then provide evidence and main results. Finally, if there is room and it has border implication one may want to expand a little bit and talk about their interpretation and how it is related to the broader context. ",

From the examples, I am not sure they are all giving a future direction, it seems some just outlining the findings. \"Discovering large samples of cluster-lensed SNe Ia with JWST.\""

One it might be a technique used to answer the research question, then I would most likely include it, but if the comparison is with the previous finding, I think it is more appropriate for the discussion section but not in the summary with limited space.  Last a comparison can be just for validation of data, then it would not be included in the summary (unless the paper is about the validation of data). I feel in this example comparison is the technique used by the authors to achieve their goals. I might include it."
